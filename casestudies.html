                            <p>At the Nuffield Foundation, I led an initiative to integrate advanced AI tools, including Co-pilot and Prompt Builder, to tackle significant administrative inefficiencies that were delaying project timelines. By translating complex business needs into actionable development tasks, creating detailed flow diagrams, and delivering comprehensive training, I successfully streamlined workflows. This strategic implementation reduced task completion times from hours to minutes, saving hundreds of administrative hours each quarter and empowering the team to dedicate more time to high-value, strategic activities.</p>

                            <p>To enhance stakeholder engagement at the Nuffield Foundation, I identified the need for a more sophisticated communication strategy targeting policy makers, journalists, and the general public. I spearheaded the implementation of Campaign Monitor, a powerful email marketing and campaign management tool. Through careful management of freelancer and agency relationships, I ensured our strategic goals were met while maintaining system integrity. The initiative resulted in a marked improvement in audience engagement, higher open rates, and more effective, targeted communication.</p>

                             <p>At PensionBee, I addressed the challenge of error-prone, manual processes that were hindering the customer experience teams. I managed system automation projects using Flow Builder and Apex, driving process enhancements and collaborating with design and development teams to deliver custom solutions. My role included overseeing the development of key compliance features and upholding data quality standards with Apex triggers. These efforts led to significant gains in process efficiency, a sharp reduction in manual errors, and a measurable increase in overall customer satisfaction.</p>
